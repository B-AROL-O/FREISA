# Pupper Head

I wanted to make a dog shaped Raspicam Holder LEGO compatible for Pupper

1. I used ComfyUI with Flux model to create a base image and Hunyuan3D model to convert the image to an STL with my [ComfyUI workflow](https://github.com/OrsoEric/HOWTO-ComfyUI#img-to-stl---3d-workflow-hunyuan) running locally on my 7900XTX

2. I used Creality Studio to cut and combine the dog head model with the OpenSCAD LEGO plate I developed for the previous hackaton and the Screwless Raspicam Holder I made in OpenSCAD

3. I sliced and printed the head with my Creality K1, first attempt was good

4. I installed the head on my red pupper and connected the raspicam. It does look like a muffler.
