# Devcontainer

The devcontainer definition available in this repo is based on the ROS2 Humble image defined in <https://github.com/Tiryoh/docker-ros2-desktop-vnc>.
As such, it includes a VNC server running Ubuntu Desktop + ROS2 (Humble), and a VNC client (noVNC) to access the environment via the browser.

The VNC client can be accessed from <http://localhost:6080>.

Inside the Devcontainer, it is also possible to connect to Tailscale.
