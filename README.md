## üå± Origins & Achievements ‚Äì Project FREISA

**[Project FREISA](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/FREISA)**, an acronym for "`F`our-legged `R`obot `E`nsuring `I`ntelligent `S`prinkler `A`utomation", continues the storyline of the [B-AROL-O Team](https://github.com/B-AROL-O?view_as=public)'s saga.

Project FREISA was the **Grand Prize Winner** ü•á of the [OpenCV AI Competition 2023](https://www.hackster.io/contests/opencv-ai-competition-2023) with [OpenCV](https://www.hackster.io/opencv), [Khadas](https://www.hackster.io/khadas) and [Seeed Studio](https://www.hackster.io/seeed).

In more recent times, FREISA was a **Finalist of [Backdrop Build v3](https://backdropbuild.com/builds/v3/freisa)** and repeated the same achievement with **[Build v4](https://backdropbuild.com/builds/freisa-wyfd)**, **[Build v5](https://backdropbuild.com/builds/freisa-beuv)** and **[Build v6](https://backdropbuild.com/builds/freisa-beuv)**:

We published multiple detailed writeups of FREISA:

* [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/projects/845012) (Nov 2023)
* [Electromaker.io](https://www.electromaker.io/project/view/four-legged-robot-ensuring-intelligent-sprinkler-automation)
* Updated version on [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/projects/89596b)

FREISA was also featured in **Issue 139 of The MagPi Magazine** with a 4-page interview:

## üöÄ Latest News ‚Äì FREISA GPT

In 2024, FREISA evolved into **FREISA GPT**, developed for the **OpenAI Open Model Hackathon**.

This new version transforms the robotic dog into an **intelligent assistant** powered by **gpt-oss-20b**.

* It listens to **voice commands** using Whisper
* Generates structured responses in **JSON**
* Executes **physical actions** (via ROS) like moving or rotating
* Displays **expressions and sounds** through a dedicated **state manager**

B-AROL-O Team response to [OpenAI Open Model Hackathon](https://openai.devpost.com/)

### Start the project

In order to make the whisper, llm and puppy communicate, please first setup the `.env` file following
the example in `.env.example` file.
Then, first start the puppy state api (inside your puppy or in your host machine):

```bash
cd ./puppy-state-api
uv run main.py
```

Then, in another terminal window:

```bash
cd ./whisper
uv run main.py
```

Now you can try talking to the puppy and saying `Hello puppy` to activate it.
Then, after the puppy is listening, try to give him some instruction to change face expression or make some sound,
for example "Can you bark for me?" or "Today I'm feeling sad.".
You should see in the terminal windows what whisper STT transcribed, what is sent to the LLM,
the LLM reasoning, the response and the calls to the puppy state manager api.

</a>

With FREISA GPT, the project moved from **smart irrigation** to **smart interaction**, making the robotic puppy not only a gardener‚Äôs helper but also a conversational, reactive companion.
