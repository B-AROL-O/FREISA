[![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/baroloteam?label=%40baroloteam&style=social)](https://x.com/baroloteam)

**[Project FREISA](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/FREISA)**, an acronym for "`F`our-legged `R`obot `E`nsuring `I`ntelligent `S`prinkler `A`utomation", continues the storyline of the [B-AROL-O Team](https://github.com/B-AROL-O?view_as=public)'s saga.

## üöÄ Latest News ‚Äì FREISA-GPT

In the last few months FREISA evolved into **FREISA-GPT**, developed in response to the [**OpenAI Open Model Hackathon**](https://openai.devpost.com/).

FREISA-GPT transforms the original FREISA robotic dog into an **intelligent assistant** powered by [**gpt-oss-20b**](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss/) open-weight Large Language Model released by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), thus implementing the following new features:

- Listens to **voice commands** using [Whisper](https://openai.com/index/whisper/) and transforms them into LLM prompts
- Generates structured responses in **JSON**
- Executes **physical actions** (for instance, to move or rotate the robot) thanks to [ros-mcp-server](https://github.com/robotmcp/ros-mcp-server) and [ROS2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/)
- Displays **expressions and sounds** through an ad-hoc **Puppy State Manager**

### How to run FREISA-GPT

To run FREISA-GPT with an emulated version of the pupper, check out the [guide](/docs/howto/howto-run-freisa-gpt.md).

With FREISA-GPT, the project moved from **smart irrigation** to **smart interaction**, making the robotic puppy not only a gardener‚Äôs helper but also a conversational, reactive companion.
