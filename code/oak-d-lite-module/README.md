# Oak-d Lite module

This folder (will contain) the code necessary to launch the Docker container used to control the Oak-d lite camera in order to perform inference and communicate the results over specific APIs in order to guide the MiniPupper.

The module will be then deployed over Docker using the same process explained in the [depthai-docker](../depthai-docker/) folder.
