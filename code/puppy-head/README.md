# puppy-head

A simple http server which enhances our FREISA dog with some features not currently exposed via ROS2 interfaces:

- change facial expressions
- play sounds

Quick-and-dirty PoC for the purpose of the [OpenAI Open Model Hackathon](https://openai.devpost.com/)

## Usage

### (Optional) Prepare a Virtual Environment

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Run the server

```bash
uv run puppy_head.py
```

Result:
