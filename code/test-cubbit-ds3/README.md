# test-cubbit-ds3

## Introduction

The [Cubbit Cloud](https://web.cubbit.io/) service, that offers TBs of space, by now doesn't have the option for an API integration.

Otherwise there's the possibility to use [Cubbit DS3 Object Storage](https://console.cubbit.eu/signin) that supports most of AWS S3 APIs.

## Register and Create Bucket

* Create an account in <https://console.cubbit.eu/signup>
* Create a new bucket by pressing "+ Create bucket"
* Generate the Keys of the repository by clicking "API keys" and then "+ Generate new client API key". Save the *Access key ID* and the *Secret access key*
